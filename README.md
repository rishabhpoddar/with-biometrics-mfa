# React native email password + biometrics auth

This example app shows how you can use SuperTokens with a React Native app to authenticate users using email-password and biometrics (as a second factor).

The auth server (in the `backend` folder) is written in NodeJS and uses the `supertokens-node` SDK. The frontend app uses the `supertokens-react-native` SDK.
